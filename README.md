In the code i explained everything.
To summarize in basic terms:
I created a student object and the constructor is => constructor(id, name, surname)
and i have a course object and the constructor is => constructor(id, name, credit, enroll)
Enroll is an array and keeps student data in course.
Everything happens in local storage, every function updates local storage and take datas from local storage.
If student and course datas will be empty, dom function will creates initial datas.
